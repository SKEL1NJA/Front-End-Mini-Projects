# Hello there! I'm Uday Khanna 👋

## 🚀 My Front-End Mini-Projects

Here are a few of the foundational projects I've built to practice and demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS.

### 1. Amazon Homepage Clone

A static, pixel-perfect clone of the Amazon homepage. This project was a deep dive into complex, real-world layouts.

* **What I built:** A faithful recreation of the top and bottom navigation bars, the hero banner, and the multi-card product grid.
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * **CSS Flexbox:** Used extensively for aligning items in the navigation bars.
    * **CSS Grid:** Implemented for the main 4-column responsive card layout.
    * **Advanced CSS:** Used `mask-image` for the hero fade effect and `z-index` with negative margins to create the signature overlapping card layout.
* **Technologies:** `HTML5` `CSS3`

### 2. Pokémon Card Flip Game

An interactive set of Pokémon-themed cards that demonstrate CSS 3D transforms and transitions.

* **What I built:** A grid of four cards that "flip" over when clicked, revealing the Pokémon on the other side.
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * **CSS 3D Transforms:** Used `transform-style: preserve-3d` and `rotateY(180deg)` to create the 3D flipping effect.
    * **CSS Transitions:** Applied `transition` to animate the flip smoothly.
    * **Event Handling (Pseudo-class):** Used the `:hover` or `:active` pseudo-classes to trigger the card animation. *(If you used JavaScript, change this to "DOM Manipulation")*
* **Technologies:** `HTML5` `CSS3`

### 3. CSS Shape Color Changer

A simple, interactive UI showcasing CSS pseudo-classes and transitions on different shapes.

* **What I built:** Three distinct shapes (square, circle, diamond) that animate their color when the user hovers over them.
* **Skills Demonstrated:**
    * **CSS Pseudo-classes:** Implemented the `:hover` pseudo-class to trigger animations.
    * **CSS Transitions:** Used `transition` to create a smooth color-fading effect instead of an abrupt change.
    * **Advanced CSS Shapes:** Created non-square shapes (like the diamond) using CSS properties.
* **Technologies:** `HTML5` `CSS3`
